It would seem that I got the urge to leave WordPress for something a little more "hackery". What I mean by that I got tired of logging into my WordPress site and seeing something about needing to update the WordPress install and the fact that I had seen several attempts of people trying to login into my site. 
</p>

Don't get me wrong however I love WordPress and will still have an install of it on some websites or my dev server. I do afterall need to keep up with it in order to make themes and do web development for other people. I just don't want it for my personal site as I feel that I have a lot more control over how I orgainize my site with static pages.

Another reason that I like Jekyll or just static pages in general is the speed that you can get with them.
