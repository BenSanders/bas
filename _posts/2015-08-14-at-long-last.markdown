A little while ago I made the decision to switch back over to WordPress and stick with it this time. I said to myself that I was going to make my own theme and learn the WordPress back end and things would be fantastic. Well fast forward to today and I am just getting to making my own theme, finally. I suppose it's better late than never and the site won't look as good until I figure out the back end and can get a design I can stick with for a while. I have a few other plans for the site as well which include turning it into a portfolio for web design and photography work. I will also keep putting up reviews for products I have used and maybe a little tech news thrown in the mix. So stay tuned for more! :)
