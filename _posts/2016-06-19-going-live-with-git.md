Git is a very cool tool of which I have been using to help me develop this site. As a matter of fact
you can go and find all the source code for this current site on my <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/bensanders/">github</a>.
But plugs aside I have installed git on my live server and just tried pushing some changes over to it vs my github. I can
get used to going live with websites like that I think. haha
</p>
<p>
Regardless it's very handy as I don't have to keep up a Filezilla window or try using any of the finiky plugins for Sublime Text or Atom to upload files. Plus I have version control with Git so that if I don't like changes I made I can revert back. Granted I haven't figured out
how to yet but the option should be there somewhere. 
</p>
<p>
So now let me just outline to you all my new work flow process for writing a post with Jekyll and Git.
</p>
<p>
1. I open a new file in Sublime Text.
2. Put all the Jekyll Front-Matter in it.
3. Write the post and edit it to look all sexy
4. Push it to the server and SHARE!
</p>
<p>
That's about it for now and I'm sure I'll refine all that later. Also this workflow allows me, as a console geek, to do 
EVERYTHING in a console window. I love everything about running console commands. <3
</p>
<p>
Till Next Time.
