title: About Ben Sanders

## Hi, I'm Ben.
I'm a web developer living in Georgia now with an associate's degree. 

I love to read and write about technology and gaming as well as playing games when I'm not writing code.
I work at Subway with hopes of either starting a tech startup or working for one and I am currently looking
for work over at Upwork. Check it out if you are looking for a web developer who is skilled in WordPress to Jekyll
websites.

I don't blog here very often but I'm hoping to change that over the coming months and will blog about a verity of topics
such as tech news and reviews. I may also post a few comics to this site and been debating developing a comic page for the
site. Either way I love the idea of working from home or just doing web development for my job. 

If you'd like to contact me I would say that Twitter is the best way to contact me. (<a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/thebensanders">@TheBenSanders</a>)

## Site History

### 2016

Moved website from WordPress to Jekyll and switch full time to DigitalOcean for hosting.

### 2015
In February of 2015 I experimated with Jekyll for the first time and made a template. 
But back then I didn't fully grasp the power of Jekyll and was just learning. You can
check out an old post from [WayBack Machine here](https://web.archive.org/web/20150203175325/http://bensanders.me/2014/01/23/blogging-like-a-hacker-2.html){:target="_blank"}. 

### 2010
Registered BenSanders.me and began this crazy journey.
